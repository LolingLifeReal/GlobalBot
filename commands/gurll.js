My thought process was thinking it would be unnecessary, however because you have the shortest temper in the world you can't just calmly reply back with a normal human response its quite hard to work with you and its probably why nope is ignoring you. I didn't want people to do unnecessary things if u just told me that mobile cant without the block part maybe people would respect u more and listen to ur ideas. Im done with this rant I just want you to know how you are acting because you arent the only developer doing things and everyone is just as important.")
